BS Grade Pointer üöÄ
A vibe-coded, laser-focused grade calculator for my peers in the IITM BS in Data Science and Applications online degree program.

What is this?
Let's be real, the grading for our courses is unique and can get complicated. Each subject has its own special formula with different weights, max() functions, and bonus rules. Trying to figure out "what you need to get" on the final few assignments can feel like a whole extra problem set.

This tool is built to solve exactly that.

It's a simple, interactive web app that has all the unique grading algorithms for our Foundation, Diploma, and Degree courses pre-loaded. No more wrestling with spreadsheets or getting the weights wrong. Just pick your course, plug in your scores, and see where you stand.

Key Features ‚ú®
Subject-Specific Logic: All the unique 'T(total score)' algorithms for our courses are already coded in. No manual setup needed.

Real-Time Grade Calculation: As you enter your scores for quizzes, assignments, and exams, your total score (T) and current letter grade update instantly.

Predictive Engine: The "Calculate What I Need" feature tells you the average score you need on your remaining assessments to hit your target grade (S, A, B, etc.).

Accurate Bonus Handling: The app correctly applies bonus marks‚Äîlike the 0-2 discretionary bonus or course-specific bonuses‚Äîonly when you're in a passing position, just like the real thing.

Vibey UI: A clean, dark-themed UI with a live background to make those late-night grade calculations a little less stressful.

Disclaimer ‚ö†Ô∏è
This is a passion project built by a fellow student to help us all navigate the program. While I've done my best to make the calculations as accurate as possible based on the official documents, this is not an official tool. Your final, official grade will always be what's posted by the IITM BS team. Please use this as a strategic guide, not as an official source of truth.
